The juxtaposition of historical sites with contemporary winter art illuminations creates a unique attraction, marrying tradition with modernity in a winter setting.<br><br>10. Yuki Matsuri: Snow Festivals Across Japan<br><br>While the Sapporo Snow Festival is the largest, Japan hosts numerous Yuki Matsuri (snow festivals) throughout its northern regions, each with its own distinctive character. For instance, the Tokamachi Snow Festival in Niigata Prefecture features large snow sculptures and an emphasis on local culture, while the Katsuyama Snow Festival in Fukui Prefecture focuses on traditional performances and activities.
